# dot - Laker's dotfiles
These are the dotfiles i use on my current machine, Oxygen.
I'm running Arch Linux with KDE Plasma as my enviroment, and using Tabby as my terminal (for now at least)

## Shell

I use the FiSH { https://fishshell.com/ } shell, with Starship Prompt { https://starship.rs } (Pastel Powerline preset)

## Editors

I use Doom Emacs for general text editing (like this file!) and stock NeoVim for configuration editing
