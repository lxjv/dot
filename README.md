# Laker's dotfiles
These are the dotfiles i use on my current machine, Oxygen.

I'm running Linux Mint 21 (cinnamon), for now.

To manage my dotfiles i use [YADM](https://yadm.io)

## Shell

I use the FiSH { https://fishshell.com/ } shell, with Starship Prompt { https://starship.rs } set to the nerd-font-icons preset

## Editors

I use 3 editors: Neovim, Doom Emacs and Helix

I switch between NV and Helix often as my general editor but Emacs is always my choice for journaling

## Music

I exclusively use a terminal music player, i just like it that way.

My choice at the moment is CMus, and i download music from either Bandcamp (support artists, yall) or YTMDL
